This weekend I am going camping with friends[n]. I packed my lantern, sleeping bag, and food[n]. I am so excited[a] to sleep[v] in a tent. Also, I am thrilled[a] because we might see hippos[n], they are kind of dangerous[a]. During our journey we are going to hike, fish, and swim[v]. I have heard that the Blue Lake is great[a] for swimming[v]. Then we will walk through the forest and search for rare[a] plants[n] and animals[n]. If I see a monkey[n] while hiking, I am going to bring it home as a pet! ! At night we will tell scary[a] stories and roast[v] turkey[n] around the campfire.
